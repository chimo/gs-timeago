# Timeago plugin for GNU social

This tiny plugin adds JavaScript on your GNU social pages so that fuzzy
timestamps ("2 minutes ago") stay up to date after the initial page load.

Thanks to the [timeago jquery plugin](http://timeago.yarp.com/) which does
all of the heavy-lifting.

# Instructions

1. Make sure the files are in a folder called Timeago if they're not already
2. Put the folder in your /plugins/ directory
3. Tell /config.php to use it with: addPlugin('Timeago');
